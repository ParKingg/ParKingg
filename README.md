Finding an available parking space can be quite inconvenient, this is mainly because most parking spaces are reserved to a certain group of people or is a company or institution exclusive, also at times, these parking spaces are full and/or can be costly. 
Ever since the rise of the internet, online reservations and transactions have been becoming a trend as these ease the transaction of the user to the company since they can transact just by logging in to the internet and visiting the company’s website without having to physically visit the company’s place. 

Nowadays, car owners are having trouble on determining available parking slot in a parking area making them to manually check if there is still an available slot inside the vicinity, doing so consumes amount of time to fully roam the area, it also consumes and a waste of gasoline/diesel thus making it costly to do so.
