Finding an available parking space can be quite inconvenient, this is mainly because most parking spaces are reserved to a certain group of people or is a company or institution exclusive, also at times, these parking spaces are full and/or can be costly. 
Ever since the rise of the internet, online reservations and transactions have been becoming a trend as these ease the transaction of the user to the company since they can transact just by logging in to the internet and visiting the company’s website without having to physically visit the company’s place.
